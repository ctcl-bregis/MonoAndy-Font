# MonoAndy-Font
Inspired by the [Monocraft](https://github.com/IdreesInc/Monocraft) font. I have started to work on making the font used by the sandbox computer game Terraria, Andy, into a monospace font that can be used in code editors and terminals.

I have just started developing this font and is my first experience with making fonts. In its current state, it may be painful to use.
